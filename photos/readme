MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY:

For the case mechanical assembly, reference the "TeensyRVLevelingCalculator - mechanical view.pdf file to identify the unique parts by color, and perform the following:
Four M2.5 x 10mm screws (RED) are inserted from the bottom, passing thru the case bottom.  Using four M2.5 nuts (SILVER), one is installed onto each screw and hand-tightened around the case bottom.  These nuts are secured to the screw using blue threadlocker, a conservative amount of which is applied to the top of each nut such that the threadlocker liquid penetrates between the screw threads and the nuts.  Four M2.5x11+6 threaded stand-offs (MAGENTA) are secured with four M2.5 nuts (NOT SHOWN) to the prototype board (GREEN) which holds all of the electronic parts.  These stand-offs secured to the prototype board are carefully aligned with the four screws inserted thru the case bottom.  The screws are tightened only halfway into the stand-offs, leaving the ability to adjust each screw individually in order to calibrate the absolute level of the project (see the CALIBRATION section below).  Four 20mm x 5mm rubber feet (with a hole punched into the center of each) are placed on the bottom, allowing access to the adjustment screws thru the center punched holes.

CALIBRATION:

Preparation:
- set the wheel base and the axle width both to 64"
- place the project on as level a surface as you can find and pay particular attention to the location placement of the project case

Step #1:
- note the initial PITCH angle reported (pitch_i)
- rotate the project case 180 degrees, making sure the place the project case back as close to the same spot as before
- note the rotated PITCH angle reported (pitch_r)
- rotate the project case 180 degrees, making sure the place the project case back as close to the same spot as before
- adjust the two screws at the top and/or bottom of the project case equally (raising and/or lowering the top and/or bottom of the project case as required) and repeat Step #1 as many times as necessary until pitch_i is approximately equal to the negative of pitch_r, centered around 0 degrees

Step #2:
- note the initial ROLL angle reported (roll_i)
- rotate the project case 180 degrees, making sure the place the project case back as close to the same spot as before
- note the rotated ROLL angle reported (roll_r)
- rotate the project case 180 degrees, making sure the place the project case back as close to the same spot as before
- adjust the two screws at the left and/or right side of the project case equally (raising and/or lowering the left and/or right side of the project case as required) and repeat Step #2 as many times as necessary until roll_i is approximately equal to the negative of roll_r, centered around 0 degrees

Final Steps:
- reset the wheel base and the axle width as appropriate for your RV/trailer
- from the bottom of the case (thru the center punched rubber feet), apply hot glue to the tops of the adjustment screws (filling the center punched holes in the rubber feet to just shy of level with the top of the rubber feet - the tops of the rubber feet should rest on whatever surface the project is set upon, without any interference from the hot glue) in order to secure the screws in place, thus preserving the calibration just performed
